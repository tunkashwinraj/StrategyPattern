# StrategyPattern
The StrategyPattern project demonstrates the use of the Strategy design pattern to implement different sorting algorithms for a list of `Student` objects. It includes ShellSort and QuickSort strategies, allowing users to switch between algorithms dynamically. The project features a SortContext and a `University` class to manage sorting strategies.
